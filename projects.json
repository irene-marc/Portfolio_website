On the left there is a map which indicates the number of players present in the championship, on the right you can see the distribution of them by age role and two top 5.\n2) **Who is the best?** Once you have chosen the nation to explore, the second page allows you to compare the players in the championship. The Cartesian axes allow you to compare players on two metrics, while the table can be used to view multiple metrics together.\n3) **Can this player improve the my team?** The last page shows how the player performs compared to his league average and compared to the average of Man City players.",

Once created the probability matrix for each players, these are used to fit the agglomerative clustring algorithm. 8 different clusters are identified among the Serie A 22/23 players. To prove the quality of the methodology also the Serie B 22/23 players were clustered obtaining promising results.",

Within the app you will find 4 pages:\n* **Scouting SerieA**: the main page of the app where each sub-page is explained.\n* **Championship Overview**: an overview of the performance of all players from the 15/16 season.\n* **Player Report**: allows you to go into detail about the performance of an individual player of interest. In detail you can view minutage, shooting ability, passing accuracy, on ball ability, effectiveness in duels, defensive skills. Finally you can serach similar players.\n* **Custom Analysis**: on this page you will find a Tableau-like interface to create your own custom charts.\n* **Glossaries**: a list of available metrics and roles.\n\n",

For each metric, a comparison is made with the team average. In addition, within the same time range, an analysis of speed and acceleration is done.\n + Session report: evaluate how the entire team performed within a specific session. ",

The Live section allows to keep track of events that happen during the match and data collection is possible through two pages:\n* **Event tagger**: on this page you can collect event data by indicating three levels of detail i.e. game situation, presence of a cross, presence of a shot. In addition, it is also possible to indicate the area of the field where the event occurred. Thanks to a stopwatch, it is possible to synchronize the events with the video.\n* **Event tagger handcontrol**: the second page allows you to collect events with a lower level of detail, but in an easier way thanks to the help of a handcontrol. \n\nBoth pages can be used during the same data collection session. At the end of the match it is possible to download the data in .csv format and in .xml format readable by LiveTagPro so that it can be imported into the video analysis software.\n\nThe Post-Match section, on the other hand, consists of a single page that allows you to import the csv and the link to the video. Once the files have been uploaded and the required inputs entered, it is possible to review the tagged portions of the match.",
